I write the code in Jupyter notebook, running on kernel Python 2.

 “IR_Kexin.ipynb”
This is the main code.
I first did data preprocessing to organize the data into list query and abstract, then I extract useful info like term frequency and other stuff to some dictionaries. And I use Numpy array to implement the final TFIDF and Cos Similarity scores. Detailed in the code.


“cosSim_rank_analysis.ipynb”

I also did a cosSim and final ranking analysis to make a criteria to transfer cosSim value to the rank value.

“kexin_output”
This is the sample output of my program 

“score”
This is the final MAP value screenshot

I have huge fun doing this program! There are many things to improve and can improve the scores. Unfortunately, I don’t have much time in order to prepare for the midterms. But I will definitely get back to this.

Thank you for reading!
